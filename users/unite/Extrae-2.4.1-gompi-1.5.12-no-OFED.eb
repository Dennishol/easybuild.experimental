description = """Extrae is the core instrumentation package developed by the Performance Tools
 group at BSC. Extrae is capable of instrumenting applications based on MPI, OpenMP, pthreads,
 CUDA1, OpenCL1, and StarSs1 using different instrumentation approaches. The information gathered
 by Extrae typically includes timestamped events of runtime calls, performance counters and source
 code references. Besides, Extrae provides its own API to allow the user to manually instrument his
 or her application."""
