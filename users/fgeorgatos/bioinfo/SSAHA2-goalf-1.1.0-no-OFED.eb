description = """SSAHA2 (Sequence Search and Alignment by Hashing Algorithm) is a pairwise
  sequence alignment program designed for the efficient mapping of sequencing reads onto
  genomic reference sequences.  SSAHA2 reads of most sequencing platforms (ABI-Sanger,
  Roche 454, Illumina-Solexa) and a range of output formats (SAM, CIGAR, PSL etc.) are supported.
  A pile-up pipeline for analysis and genotype calling is available as a separate package."""
