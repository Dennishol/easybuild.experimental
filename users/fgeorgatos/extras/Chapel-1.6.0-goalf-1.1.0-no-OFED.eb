description = """ Chapel is an emerging parallel programming language whose design and development
is being led by Cray Inc. Chapel is being developed as an open-source effort with contributions
from academia, industry, and scientific computing centers.

Chapel is designed to improve the productivity of high-end computer users while also serving
as a portable parallel programming model that can be used on commodity clusters or desktop multicore
systems. Chapel strives to vastly improve the programmability of large-scale parallel computers
while matching or beating the performance and portability of current programming models like MPI."""
