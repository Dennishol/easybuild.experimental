Being a clueless git with git, I've uploaded our successfully built easyconfigs to:

http://www.siliconslick.com/easybuild/easyconfigs/

It includes a large variety of builds (particularly bio) that aren't currently in EB.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

The README follows.

-----------------------
In this directory, you will find EasyConfigs successfully
built at some point by the staff of TAMU HPRC.

Details on the clusters below can be found at:

  https://hprc.tamu.edu/wiki/index.php/HPRC:Systems

A quick summary:

ada - a X86_64 RedHat/CentOS 6.x cluster
bgsys - a PowerPC (BlueGene/Q) environment
curie - a ppc64 RedHat/CentOS 6/7 cluster
eos - a x86_64 RedHat/CentOS 5.x cluster
neumann - a ppc64 RedHat/CentOS 6.x frontend for the bgsys above
terra - a x86_64 RedHat/CentOS 7.x cluster
Westmere - for the systems lacking AVX in ada (above)

In each directory there should be a file listing and
a downloadable copy of the repo.
