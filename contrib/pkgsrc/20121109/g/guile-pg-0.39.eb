# # There are several versions of guile; the relevant ones for this
# # module are 1.6.x, which is the old FSF version, and ttn-1.4,
# # which is a forked version of 1.4 by Thien-Thi Nguyen, the maintainer
# # of guile-pg.  fsf-1.4 is considered obsolete by nearly everyone.
# 
# # In 1.6 (but not fsf-1.4 or ttn-1.4), binary modules are deprecated.
# # guile-pg uses binary modules, and places them and scheme code in
# # $GUILE_LIBSITE, which is searched by ttn-1.4, but not by 1.6.  The
# # simplest nonproblematic solution is to symlink the installed code to
# # where 1.6 expects it.  We could patch guile-pg to install in 1.6's
# # preferred location ${PREFIX}/share/guile/site, but there is a shared
# # library which of course cannot go in share.
# 
# # In 1.8, binary modules have been removed.  Support for guile-pg to
# # use 1.8-style modules has not yet been written.
# 
# SITE=${PREFIX}/guile/1.6/share/guile/site
# 
# # guile should make the dir, but if not
# post-install:
# 	${INSTALL_DATA_DIR} ${DESTDIR}${SITE}
# 	cd ${DESTDIR}${SITE} && ${LN} -sf ../../../../../lib/guile/site/database .
