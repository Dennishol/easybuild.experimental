# # There's an apparent bug in gcc 4.1.3 on i386 (as shipped in
# # netbsd-5).  With -O2 and the stack protector (SSP) feature, the
# # function otrl_auth_handle_revealsig is badly miscompiled.
# # Therefore, we turn down optimization, since that seems better than
# # turning off the stack protector.
# 
# #Not apparently relevant, but makes -S output easier to follow.

# #A way to avoid the bug.
