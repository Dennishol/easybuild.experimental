# # This patch is taken from upstream CVS, and is from the 0.3.1 release
# # tag to head of CVS on 5 Jun 2010, although CVS last changed on 24
# # Jul 2006.  The patch fixes an error in formatting of the synthetic
# # Received: line.  The patch is a patchfile (hosted on ftp.netbsd.org)
# # instead of a pkgsrc patch because it is something upstream would
# # have released if upstream were still maintaining this code.
