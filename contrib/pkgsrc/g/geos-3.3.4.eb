# # geos has two libraries:
# #   geos_c (C), which follows normal versioning rules
# #   geos (C++), which uses -release, and changes on every release
# 
# # According to the geos project, the C++ interface should not be
# # directly used and other packages should not link against it.  This
# # is currently underdocumented:
# #   http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/553
# #   http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geos-devel/2012-June/005860.html
# 
# # Therefore, pkgsrc will perform a recursive revbump when the geos_c
# # shlib version changes, and will generally ignore geos shlib name
# # changes.  The following packages incorrectly (from the geos
# # viewpoint) link directly against -lgeos and should be revbumped on
# # every update (and fixed not to use -lgeos):
# #   geography/gdail-lib
