easybuild.experimental
======================

This git repo is a playground area for easybuild developers, as long as we all talk "Open Source" with no redistribution limits.

Basic headlines:
* **You can freely create a directory bearing your github name under ./users and work in it as you wish**
* simply present yourself and ask to be added as a collaborator in this repo, via the "Issues" of github
* commit/push directly and avoid completely any pull/request cycles - we have no time for that here
* thousands of easyconfig files built in a bulk fashion may become available, for example see *a2ps* under [contrib/pkgsrc], 
* If you cross the boundary of 100 buildable easyconfigs in some kind of provably intelligent way (Reverse Turing test, anyone?),
  the repo owner will owe you an EasyBuild towel, delivered on his birthday as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day
* whatever you do, remember the words of this pal [http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf]
